                    <td>static, relative, absolute, fixed</td>
                    <td class="description">When fixed, it is set/pinned to a specific spot on a page. The fixed element stays the same regardless of scrolling. 

                        Absolute enables an element to ignore sibling elements and instead be positioned relative to its closest parent element that is positioned with relative or absolute. The absolute value removes an element entirely from the document flow. By using the positioning attributes top, left, bottom and right, an element can be positioned anywhere as expected.

                        Relative of the CSS position property enables an element to be positioned relative to where it would have originally been on a web page.

The value left floats an element to the left side of its container and the value right floats an element to the right side of its container.
